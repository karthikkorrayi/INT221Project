# INT221Proj
Through this project, I understood the directory structure and request response life cycle in Laravel and its basic terms such as routing parameters, understanding views in Laravel, passing data to views, sharing data with all views and the responses of Laravel as well-organized, reusable and maintainable code using views and controllers.
I can make cookies and sessions to store users information across the requests.
Coming to the project, I have done a GYM management system using php along with xampp technology to store and to get the data information on the framework.
I constructed a database and used an appropriate SQL statements to create tables and store data.
